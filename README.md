## Greetings weary traveller :mage:

I'm Roemer [ˈrumər], a PhD candidate at the Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherland. Currently, I am working on renal epidemiology, which special interest in both causal inference and prediction. My background is a BSc in medicine :man_health_worker:. Besides epidemiology, I thoroughly enjoy programming, with my GitHub mainly serving the purpose of making my codes openly available (besides any free-time projects).

You can contact me through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rj_janse) or send me an e-mail at r.j.janse@lumc.nl. A list of my current publications can be found at my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0059-872X) (0000-0003-0059-872X).

Until we meet again!
