## Greetings weary traveller :mage:

I'm Roemer, a student researcher at the Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands and the Karolinska Institutet, Sweden. Currently, I am working on renal pharmacoepidemiology, which also encompasses my main interests: epidemiology and causal inference. My background is a BSc in medicine and I am currently doing my MSc in medicine :man_health_worker:.

You can contact me through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rj_janse) or send me an e-mail at r.j.janse@lumc.nl. A list of my current publications can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NUUHRvgAAAAJ&hl=nl).

Until we meet again!
